# Usage
1. âš™ Configure the desired paramters in `.env`.
2. â–¶ Run `docker-compose up` 
3. âŒ› Wait a bit: data preparation can take a while the first time.
4. ðŸ¥³ Go to `localhost:8080` in your browser

# Configuration

## Environment
Create a .env file containing the variables:
- `TAXI_DATASET`: the value must be the path to the directory containing the taxi logs.
- `MAX_TAXIS`: maximum number of distinct taxis that will be emitted by the data provider (`-1` to disable).
- `SPEED_MULTIPLIER`: changes the emission speed of the data provider. With `SPEED_MULTIPLIER=2` the emission speed is doubled.
- (optional) `MODE=DEBUG` to enable Storm throughput measurement

For example, if your dataset is located at `/aic/g1`, create the following `.env` file in the project root directory:
```
TAXI_DATASET=/aic/g1
MAX_TAXIS=100
SPEED_MULTIPLIER=1
```

# Use case
One basic use-case for this application would be the monitoring of a vehicle fleet for a company like Uber. Each Uber driver relies heavily on the smartphone to provide them with pickup jobs and to display them the most efficient routes to take. The positional data can then be taken from each app and published into the kafka server that acts as a spout for the storm topology. While traversing throught the topology this data is used in many different calculations that are then later displayed at the monitoring dashboard. Here the company can see each drivers location on a map, how many drivers there are in total and the total distance that has been driven. In addition, it shows notifications for drivers that left a certain radius from a specific center point and if someone exceeds a given speed limit. This dashboard can be a useful tool for companies like Uber to quickly evaluate e.g. the total coverage of a city and can help penalizing drivers that drive too fast and therefore provide a risk for the company.

# Optimizations
This section covers Task 5 (Stage 2).

The following optimizations have been applied:

1. The average speed bolt computes the incremental average speed, using O(1) memory per taxi. (+2% throughput)
2. ...

## Results
The results on the throughput and the processing time are the following:
- Throughput: from ... to ...
- Processing time:
